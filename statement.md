# Project Statement

## Project Title
Student Record System Using Python

---

## Problem Statement
Managing student records manually is time-consuming and can lead to errors.  
Many students and institutions need a simple system where they can store, search, update and delete student information easily without using complex software.

This project is developed to solve this problem using a console-based Python program.

---

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to build a simple Student Record System that allows users to:

- Add new student records  
- Search student records by registration number  
- Update existing student details  
- Delete student records  
- Display all stored student records  

---

## Scope of the Project
This project is a basic version of a Student Management System.  
It is designed for learning purposes and small-scale use in labs or classrooms.

The system stores data only during runtime and does not use any database or external files.  
Future upgrades can include file storage and GUI interface.

## Target Users
- Students learning Python  
- Beginners doing mini projects  
- Teachers for demonstration  
- Anyone practicing basic programming concepts  

---

## Tools and Technology Used
- Programming Language: Python  
- Data Storage: Python Dictionary  
- Interface: Command Line Interface (CLI)  
- Platform: Any system with Python installed  

---

## Conclusion
This project helps beginners understand how to use Python for real-world problem solving.  
It covers important concepts like functions, loops, dictionaries, input handling and program structure.  
It is easy to modify and expand for future improvements like database support or GUI.
